        Restaurant Partners may have this service available. When enabled,
        Lastbite Eats uses its technology platform to allocate a suitable delivery
        partner, who provides the service, in such a way that it minimises the
        delays in the orders and delivery is done within 40 to 45 minutes from the
        time of placing order. However, you acknowledge that such services are
        facilitated by the Delivery Partner on a best effort basis, hence should
        your order fail to reach you on or prior to the On Time Delivery time, you
        would be receiving a Coupon (of the value as may be communicated on the
        Lastbite Eats platform) to redeem on your next order at any restaurant.
        Further, the validity period of the Coupon would be 4(four days) from
        receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything set out herein above, the coupon
        shall not be issued if:
