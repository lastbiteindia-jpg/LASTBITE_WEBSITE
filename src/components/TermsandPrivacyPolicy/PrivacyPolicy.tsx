        transaction through our Services, your information is provided to us and

        facilitate your reservation and online food order processing, we provide

        text messages regarding your reservation or order's delivery status.
        Some restaurants also require you to provide credit or debit card
        account information to secure your reservation. When you make a
        restaurant reservation or online food ordering transaction through our
        Services and/or make a payment to a restaurant through our Services, we
        may also share with the restaurants additional information, such as
        information about your dining preferences and history or information
        that we collect from third-parties.
